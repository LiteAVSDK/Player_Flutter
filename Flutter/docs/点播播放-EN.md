## SDK Download

You can download the Tencent Cloud RT-Cube Superplayer SDK for Flutter [here](https://github.com/LiteAVSDK/Player_Flutter/tree/main/Flutter).

## Intended Audience

This document describes some of the capabilities of Tencent Cloud. Make sure that you have activated relevant [Tencent Cloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/) services before using them. If you haven't registered an account, please [sign up for free](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/account/register) first.

## This Document Describes
* How to integrate the Tencent Cloud RT-Cube Player SDK for Flutter.
* How to use the Player SDK for VOD playback.
* How to use the underlying capabilities of the Player SDK to implement more features.

## Basics
This document describes the VOD playback feature of the Player SDK. You can start by understanding the following basics:

- **Live streaming and video on demand**
  In live streaming, the video source is pushed by the host in real time. When the host stops pushing the source, the player will also stop playing the video. Because the live stream is played back in real time, no progress bar will be displayed in the player during the playback.

In video on demand (VOD), the video source is a video file in the cloud, which can be played back at any time as long as it is not deleted from the cloud. A progress bar is displayed for controlling the playback progress. Typical VOD scenarios include viewing videos on video websites such as Tencent Video and Youku Tudou.

- **Supported protocols**
  Common VOD protocols are as listed below. Currently, VOD URLs in HLS format (starting with `http` and ending with `.m3u8`) are popular.
  ![](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/4b42a00bb7ce2f58f362f35397734177/image.jpg)

## Notes
The Player SDK **does not impose any limits on the sources of playback URLs**, which means that you can use it to play back videos from both Tencent Cloud and non-Tencent Cloud URLs. However, players in the SDK support only live streaming URLs in FLV, RTMP, and HLS (M3U8) formats, as well as VOD URLs in MP4, HLS (M3U8), and FLV formats.

## How Shared Texture Works
Flutter internally provides a mechanism to share the native textures with Flutter for rendering. The following figure uses iOS as an example to show how the official external texture mechanism works:

![](texture_arch.png)

Blocks in red are the native code to be written, and blocks in yellow are the internal code logic of the Flutter engine. The entire process consists of texture registration and overall texture rendering logic.

### Registering texture

1. Create an object to implement the `FlutterTexture` protocol and manage specific texture data.
2. Use `FlutterTextureRegistry` to register the `FlutterTexture` object described in step 1 to get a Flutter texture ID.
3. Send the ID through the channel mechanism to Dart, where you can use the `Texture` widget and pass in the ID as the parameter to use the texture.

### Rendering texture

1. Create an object to implement the `FlutterTexture` protocol and manage specific texture data.
2. Use `FlutterTextureRegistry` to register the `FlutterTexture` object described in step 1 to get a Flutter texture ID.
3. Send the ID through the channel mechanism to Dart, where you can use the `Texture` widget and pass in the ID as the parameter to use the texture.
4. The Flutter engine calls `copyPixelBuffer` to get the specific texture data and uses GPU to render it at the underlying layer.


## Integration Guide[](id:Guide)

1. Add the following configuration to `pubspec.yaml`.
```yaml
super_player:
  git:
    url: https://github.com/LiteAVSDK/Player_Flutter
    path: Flutter
```

2. Update the dependency package.
```yaml
flutter pub upgrade
```

3. To integrate the Professional Edition, change the configuration in `pubspec.yaml` as follows:

```yaml
super_player:
  git:
    url: https://github.com/tencentyun/SuperPlayer
    path: Flutter
    ref: Professional
```

4. Add the native configuration.

### Android configuration[](id:Android_config)

Add the following configuration to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file of Android.

```xml
<!--network permission-->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
<!--VOD player floating window permission-->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW" />
<!--storage-->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

### iOS configuration[](id:iOS_config)

Add the following configuration to the `Info.plist` file of iOS:
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

To change the TXLiteAVSDK version depended on in the project, you can specify the version, such as `TXLiteAVSDK_Player','9.5.29016'` in the Podfile. If the version is unspecified, the latest version will be used.
```xml
pod 'TXLiteAVSDK_Player'
```

## SDK Integration[](id:stepone)

### Step 1. Apply for and integrate a video playback license[](id:step1)

To integrate a player, you need to [sign up for a Tencent Cloud account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/account/register), apply for the video playback license, and then integrate the license as follows. We recommend you integrate it during application start.

If no license is integrated, exceptions may occur during playback.

```dart
String licenceURL = ""; // The obtained license URL
String licenceKey = ""; // The obtained license key
SuperPlayerPlugin.setGlobalLicense(licenceURL, licenceKey);
```

### Step 2. Create a controller[](id:step2)

```dart
TXVodPlayerController _controller = TXVodPlayerController();
```

### Step 3. Configure event listening[](id:step3)

```dart
// Listen for the video width and height change and set an appropriate aspect ratio. You can also customize the aspect ratio, and the video texture will be stretched proportionally
_controller.onPlayerNetStatusBroadcast.listen((event) async {
  double w = (event["VIDEO_WIDTH"]).toDouble();
  double h = (event["VIDEO_HEIGHT"]).toDouble();

  if (w > 0 && h > 0) {
    setState(() {
      _aspectRatio = 1.0 * w / h;
    });
  }
});
```

### Step 4. Add a layout[](id:step4)
```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
return Container(
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
      image: DecorationImage(
        image: AssetImage("images/ic_new_vod_bg.png"),
        fit: BoxFit.cover,
      )),
  child: Scaffold(
      backgroundColor: Colors.transparent,
      appBar: AppBar(
        backgroundColor: Colors.transparent,
        title: const Text('VOD'),
      ),
      body: SafeArea(
          child: Container(
            height: 150,
            color: Colors.black,
            child: Center(
              child: _aspectRatio > 0
                  ? AspectRatio(
                aspectRatio: _aspectRatio,
                child: TXPlayerVideo(controller: _controller),
              ) : Container(),
            ),
          ))));
}
```

### Step 5. Initialize the player[](id:step5)

```dart
// Initialize the player and assign the shared texture
await _controller.initialize();
```

### Step 6. Start the playback[](id:step6)
::: Playback via URL
`TXVodPlayerController` will internally recognize the playback protocol automatically. You only need to pass in your playback URL to the `startPlay` function.
```dart
// Play back the video resource
String _url =
    "http://1400329073.vod2.myqcloud.com/d62d88a7vodtranscq1400329073/59c68fe75285890800381567412/adp.10.m3u8";
await _controller.startPlay(_url);
```
:::
::: Playback via `fileId`
```dart
TXPlayerAuthParams authParams = TXPlayerAuthParams();
authParams.appId = 1252463788;
authParams.fileId = "4564972819220421305";
await _controller.startPlayWithParams(authParams);
```
Find the target video file in [Media Assets](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/media), and you can view the `FileId` below the filename.

Play back the video through the `FileId`, and the player will request the backend for the real playback URL. If the network is abnormal or the `FileId` doesn't exist, the `TXLiveConstants.PLAY_ERR_GET_PLAYINFO_FAIL` event will be received; otherwise, `TXLiveConstants.PLAY_EVT_GET_PLAYINFO_SUCC` will be received, indicating that the request succeeded.
:::
</dx-tabs>

### Step 7. Stop the playback[](id:step7)
**Remember to call the controller termination method** when stopping the playback, especially before the next call of `startPlay`. This can prevent memory leak and screen flashing issues.
```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  _controller.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Preloading
In UGSV playback scenarios, the preloading feature contributes to a smooth viewing experience: When a video is being played, you can load the URL of the next video to be played back on the backend. When users switch to the next video, it will have been loaded and can be played back immediately.

This is how seamless switch works in video playback. You can use `isAutoPlay` in `TXVodPlayerController` to implement the feature as follows:

![](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/7331417ebbdfe6306fe96f4b76c8d0ad/image.jpg)

```dart
// Play back video A: If `isAutoPlay` is set to `true`, the video will be immediately loaded and played back when `startPlay` is called
String url_A = "http://1252463788.vod2.myqcloud.com/xxxxx/v.f10.mp4";
await _controller_A.setIsAutoPlay(isAutoPlay: true);
await _controller_A.play(url_A);

// To preload video B when playing back video A, set `isAutoPlay` to `false`
String url_B = "http://1252463788.vod2.myqcloud.com/xxxxx/v.f20.mp4";
await _controller_B.setIsAutoPlay(isAutoPlay: false);
await _controller_B.play(url_B);
```

After video A ends and video B is automatically or manually switched to, you can call the `resume` function to immediately play back video B.
```dart
_controller.onPlayerEventBroadcast.listen((event) async {// Subscribe to status change
  if(event["event"] == TXVodPlayEvent.PLAY_EVT_PLAY_END) { // For more information, see the native SDK status codes of iOS or Android
    await _controller_A.stop();
    await _controller_B.resume();
  }
});
```

## Progress Display

There are two metrics for the VOD progress: **loading progress** and **playback progress**. Currently, the SDK notifies the two progress metrics in real time through event notifications.

![](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/6ac5e2fe87e642e6c2e6342d72464f4a/image.png)

```dart
_controller.onPlayerEventBroadcast.listen((event) async {
  if(event["event"] == TXVodPlayEvent.PLAY_EVT_PLAY_PROGRESS) {// For more information, see the native SDK status codes of iOS or Android
    // Playable duration, i.e., loading progress, in milliseconds
    double playableDuration = event[TXVodPlayEvent.EVT_PLAYABLE_DURATION_MS].toDouble();
    // Playback progress in seconds
    int progress = event[TXVodPlayEvent.EVT_PLAY_PROGRESS].toInt();
    // Total video duration in seconds
    int duration = event[TXVodPlayEvent.EVT_PLAY_DURATION].toInt();
  }
});
```
