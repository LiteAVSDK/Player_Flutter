## This Document Describes

* How to integrate the Tencent Cloud RT-Cube Superplayer for Flutter.
* How to use the Superplayer component for VOD playback.

## Basics

The Superplayer SDK for Flutter is an extension of the VOD player SDK for Flutter. The Superplayer SDK is easy to use and integrates more features, including full-screen playback, video quality change, progress bar, playback control, and thumbnail title.

## Integration Guide[](id:Guide)

1. Add the following configuration to `pubspec.yaml`.
```yaml
super_player:
git:
  url: https://github.com/LiteAVSDK/Player_Flutter
  path: Flutter
```

2. Update the dependency package.
```yaml
flutter pub upgrade
```

3. Add the native configuration.

### Android configuration[](id:Android_config)

Add the following configuration to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file of Android.

```xml
<!--network permission-->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
    <!--VOD player floating window permission-->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW" />
    <!--storage-->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

### iOS configuration[](id:iOS_config)

Add the following configuration to the `Info.plist` file of iOS:
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
<key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
<true/>
</dict>
```

To change the TXLiteAVSDK version depended on in the project, you can specify the version, such as `TXLiteAVSDK_Player','9.5.29016'` in the Podfile. If the version is unspecified, the latest version will be used.
```xml
pod 'TXLiteAVSDK_Player'
```

## SDK Integration[](id:stepone)

### Step 1. Apply for and integrate a video playback license[](id:step1)

To integrate a player, you need to [sign up for a Tencent Cloud account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/account/register), apply for the video playback license, and then integrate the license as follows. We recommend you integrate it during application start.

If no license is integrated, exceptions may occur during playback.

```dart
String licenceURL = ""; // The obtained license URL
String licenceKey = ""; // The obtained license key
SuperPlayerPlugin.setGlobalLicense(licenceURL, licenceKey);
```

### Step 2. Create a controller[](id:step2)

```dart
SuperPlayerController _controller = SuperPlayerController(context);
```

### Step 3. Configure Superplayer[](id:step3)

```dart
FTXVodPlayConfig config = FTXVodPlayConfig();
// If `preferredResolution` is not configured, the 720x1280 resolution stream will be played back preferably during multi-bitrate video playback
config.preferredResolution = 720 * 1280;
_controller.setPlayConfig(config);
```

For detailed configuration in `FTXVodPlayConfig`, see the player configuration API of the VOD player SDK for Flutter.

### Step 4. Configure event listening[](id:step4)

```dart
_controller.onSimplePlayerEventBroadcast.listen((event) {
  String evtName = event["event"];
  if (evtName == SuperPlayerViewEvent.onStartFullScreenPlay) {
    setState(() {
      _isFullScreen = true;
    });
  } else if (evtName == SuperPlayerViewEvent.onStopFullScreenPlay) {
    setState(() {
      _isFullScreen = false;
    });
  } else {
    print(evtName);
  }
});
```

### Step 5. Add a layout[](id:step5)

```dart
Widget _getPlayArea() {
    return Container(
    height: 220,
    child: SuperPlayerView(_controller),
  );
}
```

### Step 6. Listen for the Back button tapping event[](id:step6)

Listen for the Back button tapping event. If the player is in full screen mode when the event is triggered, the SDK exits the full screen mode. When the event is triggered again, the SDK exits the page.
**If you want to directly exit the page from full screen playback mode, you don't need to listen for the event.**

```dart
  @override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return WillPopScope(
      child: Container(
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
            image: DecorationImage(
              image: AssetImage("images/ic_new_vod_bg.png"),
              fit: BoxFit.cover,
            )),
        child: Scaffold(
          backgroundColor: Colors.transparent,
          appBar: _isFullScreen
              ? null
              : AppBar(
            backgroundColor: Colors.transparent,
            title: const Text('SuperPlayer'),
          ),
          body: SafeArea(
            child: Builder(
              builder: (context) => getBody(),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
      onWillPop: onWillPop);
}

Future<bool> onWillPop() async {
  return !_controller.onBackPress();
}
```

### Step 7. Start the playback[](id:step7)

::: Through URL
```dart
SuperPlayerModel model = SuperPlayerModel();
model.videoURL = "http://1400329073.vod2.myqcloud.com/d62d88a7vodtranscq1400329073/59c68fe75285890800381567412/adp.10.m3u8";
_controller.playWithModel(model);
```
:::

::: Through `fileId`
```dart
SuperPlayerModel model = SuperPlayerModel();
model.appId = 1500005830;
model.videoId = new SuperPlayerVideoId();
model.videoId.fileId = "8602268011437356984";
_controller.playWithModel(model);
```

Find the target video file in [Media Assets](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/media), and you can view the `FileId` below the filename.

Play back the video through the `FileId`, and the player will request the backend for the real playback URL. If the network is abnormal or the `FileId` doesn't exist, the `SuperPlayerViewEvent.onSuperPlayerError` event will be received.

:::

### Step 8. Stop the playback[](id:step8)

**Remember to call the controller termination method** when stopping the playback, especially before the next call of `startPlay`. This can prevent memory leak and screen flashing issues, as well as ensure that playback is stopped when the page is exited.
```dart
  @override
void dispose() {
  // must invoke when page exit.
  _controller.releasePlayer();
  super.dispose();
}
```

## SDK API List[](id:sdkList)

#### Playing back video

**Description**

This API is used to start video playback.

**API**

```dart
_controller.playWithModel(model);
```

**Parameter description**

1. SuperPlayerModel

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------------------ |
| appId | int | The application's `appId`, which is required for playback via `fileId`. |
| videoURL | String | The video URL, which is required for playback via URL. |
| multiVideoURLs | List<String> | Multi-bitrate playback URLs, which are required for playback via multi-bitrate URLs |
| defaultPlayIndex | int | The default playback bitrate number, which is used together with `multiVideoURLs`. |
| videoId | SuperPlayerVideoId | `fileId` storage object, which is further described below |
| title | String | The video title. You can use this to customize the title and overwrite the title internally requested by the player from the server. |
| coverUrl | String | The thumbnail image pulled from the Tencent server, whose value will be assigned automatically in `SuperVodDataLoader`. |
| customeCoverUrl | String | A custom video thumbnail. This parameter is used preferentially and is used to customize the video thumbnail. |
| duration | int | The video duration in seconds |
| videoDescription | String | The video description. |
| videoMoreDescription | String | The detailed video description. |
| playAction | int | Valid values: PLAY_ACTION_AUTO_PLAY, PLAY_ACTION_MANUAL_PLAY, PLAY_ACTION_PRELOAD, as described below |

2. SuperPlayerVideoId 

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------------------ |
| fileId | String | The File ID, which is required |
| psign | String | Required if hotlink protection is enabled on v4 |

3. playAction

* PLAY_ACTION_AUTO_PLAY: The video will be automatically played back after `playWithModel` is called.
* PLAY_ACTION_MANUAL_PLAY: The video needs to be played back manually after `playWithModel` is called. The player doesn't load the video and only displays the thumbnail image, which consumes no video playback resources compared with `PLAY_ACTION_PRELOAD`.
* PLAY_ACTION_PRELOAD: The player will display the thumbnail image and won't start the video playback after `playWithModel` is called, but the video will be loaded. This can start the playback faster than `PLAY_ACTION_MANUAL_PLAY`.

#### Pausing playback

**Description**

This API is used to pause video playback.

**API**

```dart
_controller.pause();
```

#### Resuming playback

**Description**

This API is used to resume the playback.

**Code sample**

```dart
SuperPlayerModel model = SuperPlayerModel();
model.appId = 1500005830;
model.videoId = new SuperPlayerVideoId();
model.videoId.fileId = "8602268011437356984";
model.title = "VOD";
SuperVodDataLoader loader = SuperVodDataLoader();
// Values of the required parameters in `model` are directly assigned in `SuperVodDataLoader`
loader.getVideoData(model, (resultModel) {
  _controller.playWithModel(resultModel);
})
```
